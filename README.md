VaderCoin 🪙 is a community-driven cryptocurrency 💲 designed to represent a memory of Anakin Skywalker ❤️. The Vadercoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Vadercoin blockchain ⛓️ networks and uses the sha256 hashing method for Proof of Work ⚒️. VaderCoin is a Namecoin ℕ hard fork of version 22.0, Segwit, Taproot and Schnorr are available 😎.

The block reward and the total number of all coins became x100.  
There are ~2,100,000,000 VADE Coins. The starting reward is 5,000 VDE per block.  

## Such ports

VaderCoin Core by default uses port `6448` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `6447` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet |
| :------- | ------: |
| P2P      |   6448  |
| RPC      |   6447  |
